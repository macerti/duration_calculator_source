# Audit Duration Calculator — Source Repository

> **Repository identity:** this repository was intentionally renamed from `duration_calculator_backend` to `duration_calculator_source`. The new name is deliberate: this repository contains the authoritative application source, while `duration_calculator` is the deployable artifact repository.


GS0106 / IAF MD5 / MD1 / MD11 audit duration calculation tool — a rebuild of
`LSP0301_Outil_de_calcul.xlsm`, built to run as a free tool on your website
via DirectAdmin shared hosting: **PHP + MariaDB backend, React (Expo)
frontend built to static files.** No Node.js runtime needed on the server.

**Both pieces are required — this is not one file.** The frontend
(`src/frontend/`) is only forms and display; every GS0106 formula lives in
the backend (`src/backend/`).

**Why PHP**: this started as Node/TypeScript (see
`docs/archive/AUDIT_ENGINE_LEGACY.md`). Once it was confirmed
the target DirectAdmin host has no Node.js Selector, the engine was ported
to PHP — same formulas, same worked examples, verified against the same
test cases. PHP + MySQL/MariaDB is close to universally available on shared
hosting.

All source for the project lives here. This is the


**source** repo — for the deployable artifact actually uploaded to hosting,
see [`duration_calculator`](https://github.com/macerti/duration_calculator).



## Mandatory source/deployment separation

**This repository is the SOURCE repository. It is never the deployable artifact.**

- All application source changes MUST be made and reviewed here first.
- After a source change is tested, the developer MUST build/package the deployable artifact and publish the resulting deploy files to the separate repository **macerti/duration_calculator**.
- The duration_calculator repository is the deployment artifact / production mirror. Hosting deployment is driven from that repository, not from this source repository.
- For the PHP backend, build means producing the deploy-ready single-folder PHP tree from src/backend/; there is no PHP compilation step.
- For src/frontend/, build means running the configured Expo web export and publishing the resulting static files. A source-only frontend change is NOT deployed until its generated web artifact has been published to duration_calculator.
- Never hand-edit only the deployment repository to fix application behavior. If the source repository is not updated, the deployment change is invalid and will be overwritten by the next build.
- Every development hand-off MUST state both source commit and deployment-artifact commit, or explicitly state that deployment has not yet happened.
- A task is not deployed merely because source code was committed. Deployment is complete only when the corresponding artifact exists in duration_calculator and its deployment workflow has been run/passed where applicable.

## Layout

- **`src/frontend/`** — the actual frontend source of truth. Expo/React
  Native app (works on iOS, Android, and web from one codebase). This is
  what gets built (`npx expo export --platform web`) to produce the static
  files that ship inside the deploy repo.
- **`src/backend/`** — the PHP + MariaDB backend source, exactly
  as deployed (single-folder topology: `engine/`, `data/`, `db/`, `api/`).
  This is what the deploy repo's backend portion is built from — for PHP
  there's no separate build step, so this content is closer to
  copy-verbatim than `src/frontend/` is.
- **`audit-app/`** — no longer exists. It was an earlier two-folder-topology
  version of the PHP backend (`backend/public/` as its own doc root,
  `/api/...` as a URL namespace rather than a physical folder), plus an
  earlier version of the frontend. Deleted 2026-09-01 (repository
  architecture consolidation, step 2) after diffing every file against the
  canonical `src/backend/`/`src/frontend/` and confirming
  nothing unique would be lost — see `docs/archive/AUDIT_APP_LEGACY.md` for
  exactly what was verified. Its active living docs (`BUGLOG.md`,
  `DEV_STATUS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `ORIENTATIONS.md`, `TEST_CHECKLIST.md`,
  `DEPLOY.md`) moved to `docs/` before the deletion, and
  `SECURITY.md`/`CHANGELOG.md` moved to the repo root, per
  `REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- Historical/abandoned implementations are deleted, not kept as
  active-looking top-level folders — `REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`
  explicitly prohibits using `docs/archive/` as a dumping ground for
  duplicate code. Only a concise history note survives each deletion:
  e.g. the original Node/TypeScript engine implementation (before the
  project moved to PHP) is gone, documented at
  `docs/archive/AUDIT_ENGINE_LEGACY.md`.
- **Renamed 2026-09-02** (repository architecture consolidation, remaining
  scope closed): `audit-mobile/` → `src/frontend/` and
  `duration-calculator-php/` → `src/backend/`, via `git mv` (history
  preserved, no file content changed). This was the last item
  `REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Required target" section still had open —
  see `docs/DEV_STATUS.md`'s dated entry for the full verification that
  nothing broke (regression suite, typecheck, build) after the move.

## Quick start (local testing before deploying)

**Backend:**
```bash
cd src/backend
cp config.example.php config.php   # edit config.php with your DB credentials
php -S localhost:8000 -t .
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd src/frontend
npm install
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 npx expo export --platform web --clear
# static site is now in src/frontend/dist/
```

⚠️ Always pass `--clear` when rebuilding with a *different*
`EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` — Metro's bundler cache will otherwise silently reuse
a stale build with the old URL baked in; see `docs/BUGLOG.md`.

See `docs/DEPLOY.md` for the actual DirectAdmin deployment steps.

## Project documentation

The project's active living docs (`docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/ORIENTATIONS.md`,
`docs/TEST_CHECKLIST.md`, `docs/DEPLOY.md`, plus `SECURITY.md` and
`CHANGELOG.md` at the repo root) live in **this** source repo, since this is
where the actual development work and hand-offs happen. Whether
`duration_calculator` should also mirror a copy is a policy decision for the
team, not something this structural move decided.

**Bug/feature/tech-debt status and dev-session history are not markdown
files** — as of 2026-09-13 (fifty-seventh session) they live in this
database's `tracker_items`/`tracker_updates`/`session_log` tables, the
single source of truth, replacing hand-maintained `docs/BUGLOG.md` and
`docs/DEV_STATUS.md` (both archived into those tables via migrations
`008`/`017`–`019` and deleted, per Mahdi's explicit instruction to stop
keeping the same information in two places by hand). `docs/TRACKER_SNAPSHOT.md`
is an auto-generated, read-only, periodically-refreshed mirror of those
tables committed into this repo, so pulling it still gets you a recent read
without live database access — see `docs/ORIENTATIONS.md`'s "Logging"
section for the full mechanism.

## Credentials

No real credentials are committed anywhere in this repo — every
`config.php`/`.env` here is a `.example` template. Copy the relevant
template and fill in real values locally; never commit the filled-in file
(already `.gitignore`d).


## Mandatory CI/build ownership

`macerti/duration_calculator_source/.github/workflows/build-test-publish.yml` is the single source-owned pipeline. It is the only workflow that should build and publish the deployment artifact.

The pipeline:
1. creates a disposable MariaDB test service;
2. verifies MariaDB and PHP/PDO connectivity;
3. imports schema and seed data;
4. runs PHP and HTTP API regression tests;
5. installs and typechecks the Expo source;
6. builds the web artifact with the production API URL;
7. assembles the deployment tree;
8. publishes it to `macerti/duration_calculator`.

The deployment repository's existing FTP workflow remains separate and must not be modified as part of source CI changes.

Do not add another build workflow for the same purpose. Do not manually edit generated application files in `duration_calculator`. If CI fails, record the exact failing stage in `tracker_items`/`session_log` (a new `BUG-NNN` row and a session-log entry, via a migration if no live API access is available) before changing the implementation.


## Repository naming and source/deployment boundary

The rename from `duration_calculator_backend` to `duration_calculator_source` is intentional and must be preserved. The word `backend` was misleading because this repository contains both the frontend source and PHP backend source. `duration_calculator` remains the deployment artifact repository.

## Current architecture phase

The architecture phase governed by `REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` (`ARCHITECTURE_CORRECTION.md` now just points there — see that file for why) reached its final structural step on 2026-09-02: the canonical tree (`src/frontend/`, `src/backend/{api,engine,data,db}`), the deployment contract (`RELEASES.md`), reproducible developer commands (root `Makefile`), and the durable calculation-rules reference (`docs/CALCULATION_RULES.md`) are now all in place — see `docs/DEV_STATUS.md`'s dated entry for the full evidence trail (regression suite, typecheck, build). Two smaller definition-of-done items from that spec are intentionally not attempted this pass and are logged as open, not silently skipped: the CI/repository-hygiene checks in work package G (detecting committed secrets, stale-path references, etc. as automated checks rather than manual review), and moving the PHP `tests/` directory out from under `src/backend/` into a fully top-level `tests/` — kept co-located because the test files' relative `require`s make that the lower-risk choice for how tightly this backend's tests are coupled to it, per the spec's own "where practical" wording; see `docs/DEV_STATUS.md` for the reasoning if this is revisited.

## Repository maintenance

The repository structure has been consolidated to a single clear source of truth (`src/frontend/`, `src/backend/`) with no duplicated historical application trees. See **REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md** for the organization, cleanup, business-rule preservation, CI/CD safety, and documentation requirements this now satisfies.
