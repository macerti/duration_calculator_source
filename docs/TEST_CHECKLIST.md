# Test Checklist — Audit Duration Calculator

How to use this file: work through each numbered scenario, mark it ✅ (pass),
❌ (fail — describe what happened), or ⏭️ (skipped, note why). When you're
done with a pass, add an entry to **Test History** at the bottom with the
version tested, the date, and anything that failed. Don't overwrite old
history entries — this file's value grows the longer that log gets, since it
lets us see *when* something broke or got fixed, not just whether it
currently works.

Each scenario has a stable **ID** (e.g. `CLI-01`) — reference these IDs in
bug reports and in the history log so we can track a specific scenario's
pass/fail across versions over time.

---

## 1. Connectivity & Home

- **HOME-01**: Open the app fresh. A small status indicator (dot + text)
  appears near the top, not a large card. It shows "Connecté" (or similar)
  within a couple seconds.
- **HOME-02**: Tap the status indicator. It re-checks and updates.
- **HOME-03**: One primary button, "Mes clients" — no separate "NAE
  Calculator"/"Case Calculator" buttons.

## 2. Client management (CRUD + undo)

- **CLI-01**: Tap "Mes clients". Empty state shows helpful text if you have
  no clients yet.
- **CLI-02**: Tap "+ Nouveau client", leave the name blank, tap "Créer".
  The input field **shakes** and a red label appears: "Le nom du client est
  obligatoire." No client is created.
- **CLI-03**: Type a name, tap "Créer". You land on that client's detail
  page. The client now appears in the clients list.
- **CLI-04**: On a client's detail page, tap the pencil icon next to the
  name, change it, save. The new name shows immediately and persists after
  navigating away and back.
- **CLI-05**: On the clients list, tap the trash icon next to a client. The
  client **disappears immediately** — no confirmation dialog. A toast
  appears at the **bottom** of the screen with "Annuler" and a visibly
  **depleting** progress bar.
- **CLI-06**: Repeat CLI-05, but tap "Annuler" before the bar empties. The
  client **reappears** in the list.
- **CLI-07**: Repeat CLI-05, let the bar run out fully (~30s) without
  tapping Annuler. Refresh the list — the client is genuinely gone.
- **CLI-08**: Delete a client that has existing calculations (CLI-07-style,
  let it expire). Its calculations are **not** deleted — check via the
  database or by noting the total calculation count elsewhere didn't drop.

## 3. Calculations list per client (CRUD + undo)

- **CASE-01**: On a client's detail page, tap "+ Nouveau calcul" — lands in
  the wizard, Step 1.
- **CASE-02**: After saving a calculation (see Section 7), it appears in
  the client's calculation list with a status badge (Brouillon/Calculé/
  Validé) and the total days shown.
- **CASE-03**: Tap the trash icon on a saved calculation. Same
  immediate-removal + undo-toast behavior as CLI-05/06/07.
- **CASE-04**: Tap a saved calculation (not its trash icon). It opens back
  into the wizard, landing on the **Récapitulatif** step with the saved
  results shown.

## 4. Wizard Step 1 — Sites & Secteurs

- **SITE-01**: Type a partial sector name **without** accents, e.g.
  "telecom". Results including "Télécommunication" appear.
- **SITE-02**: Search a number, e.g. "39". Results include sectors whose
  **NACE or EAC code** contains that number, not just description matches.
- **SITE-03**: Select a sector. It appears as a chip with both its NACE and
  EAC code shown.
- **SITE-04**: Select a **second** sector for the same site. Both appear.
  There is **no hard limit of 2** — try adding a third if you have a
  real-world case that needs it.
- **SITE-05**: With 2+ sectors selected and at least one standard active, a
  "risque retenu" summary appears per standard — confirm it shows the more
  severe of the sectors' risk levels for each standard (you may need to
  pick sectors you know have different risk levels per standard to verify
  this meaningfully).
- **SITE-06**: Select multiple standards (ISO9001, ISO45001, ISO14001) as
  chips for one site.
- **SITE-07**: Add a second site ("+ Ajouter un site"). Give it a different
  name, different sector(s), different standards.
- **SITE-08**: Remove a site (when 2+ exist). Confirm the remaining site's
  data is untouched.
- **SITE-09**: Try to continue to the next step with a site missing a
  sector or a standard — the "Continuer" button is disabled with an
  explanatory hint.

## 5. Wizard Step 2 — Effectif (NAE)

- **NAE-01**: Enter a total headcount. The next question (indirect) appears
  immediately below — no need to scroll to a separate section.
- **NAE-02**: Enter indirect headcount. The next question names the exact
  remaining count: "Parmi les X personnes restantes (fonction directe),
  combien..."
- **NAE-03**: Enter non-posté headcount. If people remain, the shift-team
  section appears, again naming the exact remaining count.
- **NAE-04**: Fill the first shift team's headcount. If people still
  remain unattributed, a **second shift row appears automatically** — you
  should never need to tap an "add shift" button mid-flow.
- **NAE-05**: Keep filling shifts until the remaining count hits zero — no
  further rows should appear once fully attributed.
- **NAE-06 (the contradiction bug)**: With 2+ sites, deliberately leave one
  site's headcount mismatched (e.g. 5 people unaccounted for) while the
  *other* site's is correct. Switch to the correctly-filled site's tab —
  it should **not** show a red "incomplete" message contradicting a green
  "correct" one. Instead, expect a clear blue message like: 'L'effectif de
  "X" est complet. L'effectif de "Y" doit encore être renseigné.' and the
  primary button should read "Aller à l'effectif de Y" — tapping it should
  jump you straight to that site's personnel tab.
- **NAE-07**: Fix the mismatched site so all sites validate. The button
  reverts to "Continuer vers les facteurs" and becomes enabled.
- **NAE-08 (data-loss regression check)**: Fill in Step 2 partially, switch
  to Step 1 via the step tabs (not the Retour button), then switch back to
  Step 2. Your entered data must still be there. Repeat switching rapidly
  (tap Step 1, immediately tap Step 2, immediately type something) a few
  times — data should never silently vanish or get overwritten.

## 6. Wizard Step 3 — Facteurs

- **FAC-01**: With only 1 active standard on a site, no "Synergie" panel
  appears.
- **FAC-02**: With 2+ active standards on the same site, a "Synergie /
  Intégration" panel appears. Toggle it on, pick an integration level, add
  at least one auditor with a qualification count.
- **FAC-03**: Tick a few augmentation and reduction factors for one
  standard. Switch to a different standard (same site) via its panel —
  confirm the factors you just ticked did **not** carry over to the other
  standard (each standard's factors are independent).
- **FAC-04**: With 2+ sites, tick factors for the Siège specifically (not a
  regular site) — confirm at the Récap/Report stage that the siège's
  factor percentage is reflected in its own total, distinctly from any
  other site's.
- **FAC-05**: Leave justification text blank for a standard with factors
  ticked — proceed anyway (this only warns, doesn't block) and confirm the
  report later shows "— non renseignée —" for that standard.
- **FAC-06**: Fill in justification text — confirm it appears verbatim in
  the report later.

## 7. Wizard Step 4 — Récapitulatif

- **REC-01**: Tap "Calculer" from Step 3. Results appear grouped visually
  by year — "Visite initiale" as one bordered block (Étape 1, Étape 2,
  Rédaction du rapport), then a separate bordered block per surveillance
  year. The grouping should be immediately obvious at a glance, not just a
  small text label.
- **REC-02**: Each duration line shows a small gray "suggestion : X j" hint
  when the calculated value isn't already a clean quarter-day. Tapping the
  suggestion applies it as the new value.
- **REC-03**: Manually adjust a value with the +/− stepper. The line shows
  "(ajusté manuellement)" and a reset icon (↺) appears — tapping it
  restores the original calculated value.
- **REC-04**: The final total at the bottom updates live as you adjust
  individual values.
- **REC-05**: Tap "📄 Voir le rapport de calcul complet" — opens the full
  report (see Section 8).
- **REC-06**: Tap "Enregistrer". A success toast appears. Go back to the
  client's calculation list — the calculation is there with the correct
  status and total.

## 8. Calculation Report

- **RPT-01**: NAE section shows the actual numeric substitution for the
  shift-team aggregation, e.g. "50 (équipe clé) + √50 (somme des autres
  équipes) = 50 + 7.071 = 57.071 → 58 NAE" — not just a formula shape with
  no numbers.
- **RPT-02**: Risk/base-duration section shows the actual resolved risk
  level by name, and the real numeric substitution for the stage
  coefficient (e.g. "10 j (base) × 1.000 (coefficient d'étape 'Initial') =
  10.000 j").
- **RPT-03**: Factors section lists each ticked factor by its **real
  label** (not "Facteur #3"), with its percentage and the justification
  text.
- **RPT-04**: If synergy was configured, its section shows the capacity
  percentage and the resulting reduction.
- **RPT-05**: Programme d'audit section is grouped by year with the same
  visual separation as the Récap step.
- **RPT-06**: Sector section shows both NACE and EAC codes.

## 9. Navigation

- **NAV-01**: In the wizard, the home affordance is a small **icon**, not
  an emoji, and sits at the **start** of the breadcrumb row (before
  "Clients"), not isolated on the opposite side.
- **NAV-02**: From deep in the wizard, tap the home icon — lands cleanly on
  Home.
- **NAV-03**: From the wizard, tap "Clients" in the breadcrumb — lands on
  the clients list. Now check the **browser/native back button** — it
  should go to Home, not back into the wizard screen you just left (this
  was a real bug — confirm it stays fixed).
- **NAV-04**: Same check one level deeper: from the wizard, tap the client
  name in the breadcrumb — lands on that client's detail page. Back button
  from there should go to the clients list, not back into the wizard.
- **NAV-05**: Every wizard step is directly clickable in the step tabs once
  unlocked (not just reachable via Next/Retour) — clicking a step tab
  never loses previously entered data (see NAE-08 above, same principle
  applies to Step 3/4 too).

## 10. Responsive layout

- **RESP-01**: On a narrow/mobile-width window, the wizard's step
  navigation is a **bottom-fixed** tab bar.
- **RESP-02**: On a wide/desktop-width window, the step navigation moves
  to a **top row** instead, and content doesn't stretch edge-to-edge —
  text and cards stay a reasonable reading width, centered.
- **RESP-03**: The clients list shows **2 columns** at desktop width, 1
  column on mobile.
- **RESP-04**: Resize the browser window across the mobile/tablet/desktop
  breakpoints while on any screen — layout should adapt without anything
  visually breaking (overlapping text, cut-off buttons).

## 11. Data persistence & backward compatibility

- **DATA-01 (the blank-page bug)**: Open a calculation that was saved
  before this version, if you have one from before this fix. It should
  open normally — showing the Récap with whatever data it has — **not** a
  blank white page.
- **DATA-02**: If anything ever *does* crash while you're using the app,
  confirm you see an actual error screen ("Un problème est survenu...")
  with a "Retour à l'accueil" button — never a silent blank page. If you
  ever see a truly blank page again, that's a real bug — please report
  exactly what you did right before it happened.

## 12. Toast system

- **TOAST-01**: Simple toasts (save confirmations, error messages) appear
  and auto-dismiss after a few seconds, positioned near the **bottom** of
  the screen.
- **TOAST-02**: Undo toasts (delete actions) show the depleting progress
  bar clearly, and don't visually overlap with the wizard's bottom step
  tabs when both could theoretically be on screen.
- **TOAST-03**: Trigger multiple toasts in quick succession (e.g. delete
  two clients back to back) — they should stack sensibly, not overlap
  illegibly.

## 14. BUG-004 wizard persistence regression tests

- **SAVE-01**: Start a brand-new calculation with the API available and MariaDB connected. The wizard's initial draft POST succeeds and receives a case ID. The wizard may then autosave by PUT; no false unsaved state is shown.
- **SAVE-02**: Make the initial draft POST fail (stop the PHP API or block the request). The wizard must **not** silently mark itself hydrated. It must show an explicit draft-save error and provide **Réessayer l'enregistrement**.
- **SAVE-03**: Restore the API and tap **Réessayer l'enregistrement**. A case ID is obtained and subsequent autosave PUTs are allowed.
- **SAVE-04**: Run the MariaDB + PHP HTTP regression suite in `backend/tests/http_api_test.php`. It must pass: health/DB → POST draft → PUT case → GET persisted case/status/rounding overrides → NACE search → NACE code → DELETE cleanup.
- **SAVE-05**: Test the exact browser/device lifecycle: mount → initial draft POST → edit wizard → calculate → Enregistrer → leave → reopen the calculation. Confirm the saved calculation opens with the expected persisted data.

### 2026-08-31 status

- SAVE-01: ⏭️ **Not runtime-verified in this session**. Test harness exists; MariaDB runtime unavailable locally and no observable CI run.
- SAVE-02: ⏭️ **Not browser/device-verified in this session**. Code path changed to surface the error and expose retry.
- SAVE-03: ⏭️ **Not browser/device-verified in this session**.
- SAVE-04: ⏭️ **Not executed in this session**. The test script and CI workflow were added.
- SAVE-05: ⏭️ **Not executed in this session**.

## 13. Security spot-checks (things you can verify yourself, no dev tools needed)

- **SEC-01**: Visit `https://tools.macerti.com/duration_calculator/db/schema.sql`
  directly in a browser. Expect a **403 Forbidden**, never the raw file.
- **SEC-02**: Visit `.../data/raw/nace_risque_table.csv` directly. Same —
  expect 403.
- **SEC-03**: Visit `.../config.php` directly. Since PHP executes rather
  than serves this file's text, you should see a blank page or a redirect
  — never the file's actual PHP source or your DB password in plain text.
- **SEC-04**: If you ever get an unexpected error from the app, check that
  the on-screen message is generic (not a raw PHP error mentioning file
  paths or database details) — if you ever see a raw technical error
  message on screen, that's a regression worth reporting immediately.

## Test History

Append a new entry each time you work through a pass. Don't edit or delete
old entries — this is the whole point of the log.

### Template for new entries

```
### vX.Y.Z — YYYY-MM-DD
Tested by:
Sections covered:
Failures: <list scenario IDs and what happened, or "none">
Notes:
```

### v4.0.0 — not yet tested by Mahdi as of this checklist's creation

This checklist was created alongside v4.0.0. No test pass has been logged
against it yet — the first real entry above should be the first time this
checklist gets used.

### v5.1.1 — 2026-09-02

Tested by: seventh session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: SAVE-04 only (HTTP regression suite). SAVE-01/02/03/05 and every other section above still need real browser/device testing — not touched this session.
Failures: none in the final run — but this pass exists precisely because SAVE-04 failed first. See notes.
Notes: This pass reconciles BUG-030 (`docs/BUGLOG.md`) — a router bug that misrouted every multi-segment API path (`/nace/*`, `/cases/:id`) under some `php -S` invocations but not others, which is why an earlier session's SAVE-04 run reported 16/16 while a later one reported 5/16 for what looked like the identical command. Ran `http_api_test.php` under both previously-divergent invocation styles this session: reproduced 5 passed/11 failed first (confirming the bug was real, not a fluke), then 16/16 under both styles after fixing the router to use an explicit `basePath` config value instead of `SCRIPT_NAME`. `smoke_test.php` 24/24, unaffected. No frontend/browser/device testing performed this session.

### v5.1.1 — 2026-09-02 (eighth session) — first real Apache/.htaccess topology pass

Tested by: eighth session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: SAVE-04 (HTTP regression), re-tested against real Apache + mod_rewrite + mod_php instead of `php -S` for the first time in this project, with the real production `basePath` (`/duration_calculator/api`) actually set. Also covers `.htaccess` security deny-rules, which no prior pass had tested against a real webserver at all.
Failures: 0/13 in the protected configuration. Additionally ran the same checks with `AllowOverride None` (Apache's default) to confirm the deny-rules and rewrite routing are not vacuously passing — see failure-mode result below.
Notes: 13/13 checks passed with `AllowOverride All` set: all 7 routing/CORS checks (health, NACE search, NACE code lookup, POST/GET/PUT/DELETE cases, OPTIONS preflight) and 5 `.htaccess` deny-rule checks (`db/schema.sql`, `db/pdo.php`, `data/raw/*.csv`, simulated `.bak`/`.swp` leftover files), plus security headers on a live Apache response. **Important negative-control result**: with `AllowOverride None` (Apache's own default, not this app's fault but a real hosting-configuration dependency), `GET /api/health` returns 404 (API entirely unreachable) and `GET /db/schema.sql` returns 200 (schema file leaks) — confirming the passing result above is not vacuous, and that the real DirectAdmin host's `AllowOverride` setting has never been confirmed and is a genuine open risk in either direction. See `docs/BUGLOG.md` BUG-030 and `docs/DEV_STATUS.md`'s eighth-session entry for full detail. No frontend/browser/device testing performed this session.

### v5.1.4 — 2026-09-03 (sixteenth session) — BUG-038, no browser/device available

Tested by: sixteenth session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: none of the numbered UI sections above — this was a targeted fix to the OAuth callback error path only (not in this checklist's section list; SSO is tracked via `docs/BUGLOG.md`/`docs/DEV_STATUS.md`, not a numbered section here since FEAT-002 is deprioritized). `smoke_test.php` 24/24 re-run to confirm no regression to the calculation engine.
Failures: none in the final state — but this pass exists because it caught a real crash-risk bug (uncaught `URIError` from a double-`decodeURIComponent()` in `useAuth.ts`) before shipping it, not because anything failed a pre-written check. See notes.
Notes: Mahdi's live retry of Microsoft sign-in produced the evidence this session needed (`⚠ invalid_request`), confirming BUG-037's frontend fix works correctly in production for the first time. Root cause of *this* session's fix: the callback route discarded `error_description`, the only part of Microsoft's response that actually explains anything. Fixed for both Microsoft and Google callbacks. No real host/browser access exists from this sandbox (same limitation as every SSO session before this one), so verification was: `tsc --noEmit` clean, `php -l` clean, direct CLI router invocation confirming the new server-side log line and a 302 exit, an isolated PHP snippet confirming the exact redirect URL string, and a Node.js `URLSearchParams` round-trip confirming the frontend decodes it losslessly — including a deliberately-injected `%` in the description, which reproduces a crash under the pre-fix code and is confirmed fixed under the new code. The actual reason Microsoft rejects the request is still not known; next real test needs Mahdi's next retry, reported verbatim.


### v5.2.0 — 2026-09-08 (forty-first session) — FEAT-010 tracker routes, no browser/device available

Tested by: forty-first session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: none of the numbered UI sections above — backend-only, no UI exists for this feature yet. New coverage: the 7 `/admin/tracker/*` routes (list with status/type/priority filters, get-by-code with update history, create, partial update, delete, log-an-update, next-code suggestion), all permission- and CSRF-gated.
Failures: 0. Fresh-DB `migrate.php` (5/5 applied, idempotent on re-run) → `seed.php` → `smoke_test.php` **24/24** → live `php -S` → `http_api_test.php` **82/82** (65 pre-existing + 17 new tracker tests).
Notes: also manually exercised the full CRUD lifecycle by hand against a live server (register → verify → login as the auto-bootstrapped admin → list/filter/next-code/create/get/update/log-update/delete/confirm-gone) before writing the automated tests, per this project's own standing rule not to trust a fix from reading the code alone. Assertions written against the real 13-row seeded backlog baseline, not an assumed-empty list. No frontend testing performed — `AdminTrackerScreen.tsx` doesn't exist yet.


### v5.2.0 — 2026-09-08 (forty-second session) — fresh-baseline re-confirmation + frontend build verification, no browser/device available, no code changes

Tested by: forty-second session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: none of the numbered UI sections above — this was a re-verification pass, not new feature testing. Re-ran the forty-first session's backend suite fresh (fresh DB every time, per this project's standing rule not to assume a prior session's numbers still hold) and, separately, ran the frontend build pipeline for the first time since the tracker work began.
Failures: 0. Fresh-DB `migrate.php` (5/5 applied, idempotent re-run) → `seed.php` → `smoke_test.php` **24/24** → live `php -S` → `http_api_test.php` **82/82** — identical counts to the forty-first session, independently re-confirmed rather than assumed. Frontend: `npm install` (516 packages, first install in this sandbox), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx expo export --platform web --clear` → **558 modules** (matches the last known-good count), `make build-deploy` → all 4 deployment-artifact checks pass, `scripts/check-repo-hygiene.sh` → all 4 checks pass.
Notes: this closes the forty-first session's own hand-off item 3 ("full frontend verification, first thing, before any of the above is trusted... don't assume 5.2.0 builds clean until this actually runs"). No frontend source file changed this session — `AdminTrackerScreen.tsx` still doesn't exist — so this confirms only the pre-UI baseline; whoever writes that screen must re-run this same sequence before trusting their own change.


### v5.3.0 — 2026-09-08 (forty-fourth session) — `AdminTrackerScreen.tsx` built and wired in, no browser/device available

Tested by: forty-fourth session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: none of the numbered UI sections above — new coverage: `AdminTrackerScreen.tsx` (list/filter/detail/create/edit/log-update/delete), reachable via `ProfileScreen`'s new `manage_tracker`-gated button. First session where the tracker has an actual UI, not just API routes.
Failures: 0. Backend baseline reconfirmed unchanged: fresh-DB `migrate.php` (5/5, idempotent) → `seed.php` → `smoke_test.php` **24/24** → live `php -S` → `http_api_test.php` **82/82**. Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx expo export --platform web --clear` → **559 modules** (558 + 1, exactly as the forty-second session predicted), `make build-deploy` 4/4, `scripts/check-repo-hygiene.sh` 4/4 (secret-scan included).
Notes: no automated frontend tests exist for this screen (DEBT-004 — no frontend unit-test framework in this project yet) and no live click-through was possible (same standing sandbox limitation as every prior frontend feature) — verification here is typecheck + build + hygiene only, not behavioral. Whoever gets real browser/device access should click through: create an item, log an update, change status/priority, filter by each of the three pickers, delete with the two-tap confirm.


### no version — 2026-09-08 (forty-fifth session) — migration 006 (FEAT-010 self-row) + stale-baseline test fix, no browser/device available

Tested by: forty-fifth session (automated, sandboxed container — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: none of the numbered UI sections above — backend/test-only session, no frontend files touched.
Failures: 0 in the final state, after fixing 2 genuinely stale assertions. Fresh-DB `migrate.php` (6/6 applied, idempotent) → `seed.php` → `smoke_test.php` **24/24** → live `php -S` → `http_api_test.php` **82/82**.
Notes: applying migration 006 (seeds the FEAT-010 tracker row) legitimately moved `tracker_items` from 13 to 14 rows, which broke two hardcoded `count === 13` assertions in `tests/http_api_test.php` — both updated to 14, same category as a prior session's permission-count fix, not a real regression. Separately, this session initially produced 35 false-positive failures from running the suite twice against an already-populated database without resetting in between (the suite's own test registrant doesn't bootstrap as admin on a non-fresh DB) — caught before treating it as a code problem; database dropped and rebuilt, and the final run's output was captured to a file and inspected once, deliberately not re-invoked live a third time.


### no version — 2026-09-09 (forty-sixth session) — DEBT-002 part 1 (AdminRoles/AdminUsers maxWidth bump), first cold-container environment setup, no browser/device available

Tested by: forty-sixth session (automated, sandboxed container, freshly provisioned PHP+MariaDB — no browser/device available)
Sections covered: `AdminRolesScreen.tsx`, `AdminUsersScreen.tsx` — layout-width change only, no behavioral/logic change to either screen.
Failures: 0. Backend baseline reconfirmed unchanged from a cold environment: fresh-DB `migrate.php` (6/6, idempotent) → `seed.php` → `smoke_test.php` **24/24** → live `php -S` → `http_api_test.php` **82/82**. Frontend: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npx expo export --platform web --clear` → **559 modules** (unchanged from the forty-fourth session's count — no new dependency), `make build-deploy` 4/4, `scripts/check-repo-hygiene.sh` 4/4.
Notes: first session to provision PHP+MariaDB from a bare container rather than continuing an already-set-up one; confirmed the `php -S`-only "background process doesn't survive between tool calls" limitation (twenty-first session) also applies to `mysqld`, worked around with a single consolidated shell script covering the whole migrate→seed→test→teardown sequence. No live click-through possible for the width change — nothing here confirms it actually reads well at 1100px on a real desktop, only that it builds and typechecks. `BUG-051` was investigated this session (see `docs/DEV_STATUS.md`'s forty-sixth-session entry) but no code changed, so no new test coverage from it.



## Mandatory source/deployment separation

**SOURCE REPOSITORY RULE:** this repository is the source of truth and is never the deployable artifact. Every application change must be made here first, tested here, then built/packaged and published to **macerti/duration_calculator**. For PHP, the deployable tree is produced from src/backend/ (no compilation). For src/frontend/, the deployable frontend is the generated Expo web export; source-only frontend changes are not deployed until the generated artifact is published to duration_calculator. Never fix application behavior only in the deployment repository. Every hand-off must record the source commit and deployment-artifact commit, or explicitly state that deployment is pending. A task is not deployed until the corresponding artifact exists in duration_calculator and its deployment workflow has been run/passed where applicable.


### 2026-08-31 — CI test pipeline hand-off

**CI environment is disposable and self-contained**
- MariaDB: 10.11 service container.
- Database: `audit_test`.
- CI user: `audit`.
- CI credentials are defined inside the workflow solely for the disposable test service; they are not production credentials.
- PHP is tested against the same `src/backend/` deployment topology used to assemble the deployment artifact.
- The workflow performs separate MariaDB-client and PHP/PDO connectivity checks before schema import.

**Required CI gate order**
1. MariaDB service healthy.
2. MariaDB client `SELECT 1` succeeds.
3. PHP/PDO connection succeeds using generated CI config.
4. Schema import succeeds.
5. Seed succeeds.
6. PHP engine smoke tests pass.
7. PHP API starts and `/health` reports DB connected.
8. HTTP regression tests pass, including NACE and POST/PUT/GET/DELETE case lifecycle.
9. Frontend `npm ci` succeeds.
10. TypeScript check succeeds.
11. Expo web export succeeds.

**Current status**: the corrected workflow has not yet completed all gates successfully. A developer picking this up must inspect the latest GitHub Actions run before repeating any individual test.


## 2026-09-01 — Acceptance gate

After FEAT-003 and repository architecture work, the next manual test cycle is a deliberate user-feedback pass. Test BUG-025/026/027 and record the user's acceptance or requested changes before resuming the general backlog.


## 2026-09-01 — Production-quality / routing / SEO audit gate

After the mandatory versioning and repository-architecture work, include a dedicated browser audit covering FEAT-004 and BUG-029. Test: production title/favicon; no Vite/React/default placeholder identity; invalid public URL → branded 404; direct load/refresh; browser back/forward for any new routes; wizard state preservation and no sensitive data in URLs; public metadata/canonical/robots/sitemap behavior; mobile/desktop layout; browser console errors; production source-map exposure; production bundle loading/performance; image alt/accessibility; structured-data validity where used.

Do not treat SEO checklist completion as sufficient evidence. Confirm that routing and metadata fit the actual boundary between public pages and private/stateful calculation workflows.
