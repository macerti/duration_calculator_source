# Deployment-artifact checks — Work Package G, REPOSITORY_ARCHITECTURE.md
# "G. Repository hygiene" bullet 5 ("deployment package contains only
# intended files"), extended 2026-09-02 (fourteenth session) to also catch
# the OPPOSITE direction — files the artifact is MISSING that it actually
# needs — after that exact gap caused a full production outage. See
# docs/BUGLOG.md BUG-036 for the full incident.
#
# The Makefile/CI "assemble deployment artifact" step already asserts a
# handful of required files are PRESENT (test -f ...). This script checks:
#   1) nothing UNEXPECTED is present (real config.php, stray .env, OS
#      cruft, a vendored node_modules tree, etc.)
#   2) every PHP require/require_once in the artifact actually resolves to
#      a real file inside it — see BUG-036 below.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-deploy-artifact.sh [dir]   (default: _deploy)

# Structural completeness: every require/include of the form
# `__DIR__ . '/relative/path.php'` (this codebase's consistent style — see
# any file under src/backend/) must resolve to a real file INSIDE the
# artifact — not just a real file somewhere. This is the generalized
# version of two different real bugs this check has now caught: (1) a new
# src/backend/auth/ module was require_once'd from api/index.php but the
# assembly step wasn't updated to copy it, so the live artifact
# fatal-errored on every single request (the original reason for this
# check); (2) DEBT-004's tests/ relocation (fifty-fourth session) briefly
# gave tests/backend/smoke_test.php a path that escaped the artifact
# entirely and resolved to the source tree instead — undetectable by a
# plain file-exists check run from inside a full checkout, where that
# source tree happens to still be sitting right there. Presence checks for
# individual files (in Makefile/CI) only catch modules someone remembered
# to list; this catches ANY missing OR artifact-escaping require, present
# or future, without needing to know its name in advance.

# Known blind spot, documented rather than silent: tests/smoke_test.php
# (fifty-fourth session, DEBT-004) resolves its requires through a runtime
# $backendRoot variable, not a literal __DIR__ . '...' string, because the
# same file needs a genuinely different relative depth depending on
# whether it's running from the repo (tests/backend/) or from this
# artifact (tests/) — a static grep can't evaluate that branch, so this
# check does not verify that file's requires at all, in either direction.
# Deliberately not worked around by making the grep pattern (or the PHP)
# more clever — that trades a real, simple, provably-correct manual check
# for a fragile one. Verified a different way instead: this session copied
# _deploy/ to a location with nothing else around it and ran
# `php tests/smoke_test.php` from there directly (24/24), which is a
# stronger check than this script performs anyway (it actually executes
# the code, rather than only proving a path resolves to *some* file).
# Re-run that manual check if smoke_test.php's resolution logic ever
# changes again.
